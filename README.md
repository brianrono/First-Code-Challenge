# Title: First-Code-Challenge

# Description: The Code Challenge Involves Three Challenges
Contains amazing challenges for managing tasks and increasing performance and productivity.
## Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator
The code pompts the user to input student marks and the input should be between 0 and 100. 
So the user iputs a score between 0 and 100 and the code returns the grade according to the user input.
This is how the marks are interpreted.
A > 79, B - 60 to 79, C -  59 to 49, D - 40 to 49, E - less 40.

## Challenge 2: Speed Detector 
This is a challenge whereby a program that takes as input the speed of a car e.g 80. If the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.
For example, if the speed is 80, it should print: “Points: 2”. If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function should print: “License suspended”.

## Challenge 3: Net Salary Calculator
This is the final program whose major task is to calculate an individual’s Net Salary by getting the inputs of basic salary and benefits. It calculates the payee (i.e. Tax), NHIFDeductions, NSSFDeductions, gross salary. The final result is the Net Salary of the individual which is achieved after all the deductionsare made.
